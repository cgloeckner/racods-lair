Thanks for playing :)


~~===~~ System requirements ~~===~~

The following is suggested:
  - OS: Windows, Linux
    (try wine on other systems)
  - CPU/GPU/RAM: unspecified, sorry :D
    It runs on my netbook (1.6 GHz, 2 GB Ram, integrated Intel graphics
    card) if lighting is disabled (due to GPU)
  - Software dependencies: see section on windows or linux build (below)

Note: playing in multiplayer will increase the GPU's workload if
lighting is enabled.


~~===~~ How to report ~~===~~

Error reporting is crucial to software of all kind. So feel free to
report any errors - like typos or more serious errors or crashes - to
me. Please visit

    https://github.com/cgloeckner/racods-lair/issues

to check whether your problem has been reported yet. If not you're
welcome! In case you already have a github account, please create a new
issue directly. Otherwise, you can use the above links to indiedb page,
twitter profile, facebook page, sfml-dev.org or spieleprogrammierer.de
forum thread of the game.

Anyway, please attach the crash.log and a more detailed description of
what you where doing. The logfile's path depends on your system:

    Windows: %APPDATA%\racod\crash.log
    Linux: ~/.local/share/racod/crash.log


~~===~~ Game Controls ~~===~~

The menu can be controlled either via keyboard (arrow keys, space/return,
escape) or by using a gamepad. There is no mouse support implemented, yet.
The actual game's controls can be customized after profile creation. Due
to the alpha state of the game, some keys are not used yet (like switching
the selected quickslot).

The major concept of range-based combat is the differentiation of moving
and looking. Thus both actions can be performed from each other. Here's
a quick overview:
  - At default, the character is looking towards the movement direction
    while moving. This automatic looking can be disabled or re-enabled.
  - Press a key for any looking direction (or the "Toggle Automatic Facing"
    key) to disable autolooking. The character will keep looking to the
    same direction, despite moving to another one.
  - Press the "Toggle Automatic Facing" key again to re-enable automatic
    facing. Now the character will always face the direction which it he
    moving to.

In the later game, a tutorial will cover this aspects.


~~===~~ Multiplayer ~~===~~

The multiplayer is local only using one machine. You can adjust the camera
behavior through the settings menu's "Automatic Camera" option.
If enabled, the camera will automatically split and merge depending on
the players' positions. This behavior might be a bit disturbing, so it
can be easily disabled during the game. After that, you have the option
to manuelly setup the camera distribution across all players.

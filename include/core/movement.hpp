// Movement System

/// MovementSystem handling movement interpolation and move event propagation
/**
 *	Each object with max_speed>0 can be moved within its scene. Furthermore
 *	this movement speed can be manipulated by changing the speed_factor field
 *	of a movement component. While each interpolation, the current movement
 *	vector is used to calculate a new world position.
 *	When starting a movement, an event is propagated which tells about which
 *	object is leaving which tile. So e.g. the collision system can be notified
 *	and triggered to perform collision checks. If a collision was detected,
 *	the movement system can be notified about this, the movement is canceled
 *	and the object's position is reset to the previous value.
 *	Once an object reached a new tile, another event is propagated which tells
 *	other systems about which object reached which tile. This can be used e.g.
 *	for bullet collisions.
 *	Keep in mind that this system will NOT change any of the scene related
 *	settings (e.g. the relationship to an object position's corresponding
 *	tile). Note also, that large frametimes are cut into multiple chunks of
 *	smalle frametimes to guarantee that all relevant tiles are visited during
 *	a movement. Also a maximum max_speed is applied if a component provides
 *	an exceeding value.
 *	There is no notification about each position in between. To let the render
 *	system know about each position (e.g. to calculate proper screen positions)
 *	is done via dirty flag. The dirty flag is set by the movement system after
 *	it changed a world position. If not, the flag isn't set. It is reset by
 *	the render system after processing the new position.

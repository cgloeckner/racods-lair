 *	CollisionEvents are received from the physics system to stop movements.
 *	ActionEvents, which contain actions like attacking, are forwarded to the

 *	DeathEvents are received to detect objects' death.
 *	Actions are only forwarded. Once they are performed, the ActionSystem is
 *	notified via AnimationEvents about the current behavior. Movement is also
 *	forwarded only. Once a movement started, the ActionSystem is notified via
 *	MoveEvents to finally start the movement animation. In case of collisions
 *	or if the actor stopped its movement, the movement animation is also

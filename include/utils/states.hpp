 * The application also handles the window and the entire process of polling
 * events, event propagation to the current state as well as updating and
 * drawing the current state. While the integrated mainloop, also framerate
 * limitation is done. Each second the application propagates the number of
 * frames occured during the previous second to its current state. So it's up

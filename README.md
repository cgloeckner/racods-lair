Since I'm out of time, the development for [Racod's Lair](http://www.indiedb.com/games/racods-lair/) is paused pending further notice. Feel free to contribute to the project if you like to. I plan to return at one time, but I'm totally not sure when this will be. Sure you'll be added as author if you want to participate :)
